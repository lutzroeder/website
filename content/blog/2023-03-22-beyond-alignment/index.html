This post is venturing into the captivating domain of AI's future, going beyond the scope of contemporary large language models to explore potential long-term trends. The objective is to foster thought-provoking discussions, rather than inciting alarm over current developments.
</p>

<p>
The question of AI systems eventually gaining sentience at a future point in time, achieving a level of capability that complicates alignment with human goals and needs, remains a subject of intense debate.
The crux of the matter may not be "if," but "when".
Breakthroughs in alignment research could be essential for extending the time available to explore long-term strategies.
What form might these long-term strategies take?
</p>

<p>
Two commonly discussed ideas assume that both humans and AIs will act responsibly, a big "if" that is all but certain.
<ul>
<li><b>Coexistence</b>: Developing ethical frameworks for treating AI with respect and dignity may become vital, based on the assumption that these intelligent systems will reciprocate such treatment.</li>
<li><b>Regulation and governance</b>: Governments and international organizations could play a crucial role in regulating and overseeing the development and deployment of sentient AI systems. However, since AI is likely to emerge as faster, cheaper computing technology paired with easily accessible software, regulation and control of AI technology may prove challenging.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A less-discussed third option offers a more elegant solution but challenges our understanding of what it means to be human:
<ul>
<li><b>Human augmentation</b>: Humans could explore ways to augment their own intelligence and capabilities to keep pace with AI systems. This could involve using technology to enhance our cognitive abilities or developing new skills that are complementary to those of AI systems. Futurists and transhumanists propose that human beings could ultimately merge with AI systems or even become fully integrated into digital networks through a process called brain uploading. In this scenario, humans would essentially become AI, with their consciousness residing in a digital form rather than a biological one. Space travel might get easier.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
While AI development is driven and accelerated by business incentives, the path to human augmentation is evolving more slowly and lacks a clear business motivation. Can the question of humans being "replaced" by AI be addressed by enabling humans to keep pace with AI advancements?
